This is Cucumber.

This was my little pet OS/Kernel that I started in 2011 as I first got into 'serious' low-level programming.

It has received a number of updates over the years: built-in Lua, 64-bit support.. but it never even got to privilege separated tasks.

Its architecture is quite broken, and this is likely a project with no future, and no use other than a snapshot of my chutzpah :).
